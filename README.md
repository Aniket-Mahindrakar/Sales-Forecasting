# Sales Forecasting
## Business Impact
### I. Inventory Cost Optimization
Accurate demand forecasting helps reduce excess stock, minimize storage costs, and prevent product expiry or obsolescence.
* 10–25% reduction in inventory holding costs
* For a company spending $5M/year on inventory, this translates to: $500,000 – $1,250,000 in annual cost saving

### II. Increase in Revenue Through Better Demand Fulfillment
With fewer stockouts and more accurate supply planning, companies are able to meet customer demand consistently and avoid missed sales.
* 3–8% increase in annual revenue
* For a business with $20M/year revenue, this results in: $600,000 – $1,600,000 in additional yearly revenue

### III. Supply Chain & Logistics Efficiency
Better predictions reduce emergency orders, lower transportation costs, and improve warehouse utilization.
* 8–12% reduction in logistics and operational costs
* For a company spending $2M/year on supply chain operations: $160,000 – $240,000 in yearly savings
